Description: spritzer is a set of R functions developed for detecting strictly
  or nearly periodic signals in time series dominated by red noise. It is 
  based on code developed and used in "A Bayesian test for periodic signals 
  in red noise" by Vaughan S. (2010, MNRAS, 402, 307). The name SPRITZER is a 
  blend of the words Strictly Periodic Tester.
